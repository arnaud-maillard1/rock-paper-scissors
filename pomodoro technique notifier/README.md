Pomodor Timer With Python
=============================================
By : Fardin Pratama Yudha

This application helps us manage time in doing
an assignment using the Pomodoro technique. the 
application will notify when to focus and when 
to rest (according to our rules) via a notification. 
this process uses the win10toast library. other than 
that there is an additional feature where when the 
focus time the program will automatically block 
several websites (social media) to avoid any distractions. 
for GUI design using the Tkinter library.

---- Good luck. ----
